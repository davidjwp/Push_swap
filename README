the way the this algo works is by finding the fastest way to send the right elements from stack A to stack B
then when stack A is empty push the biggest of stack b until stack B is empty.

This method works well but is a bit slow, it does not make use of double movements like RRR or RR thus it could be much faster.

if in the future you want to make it go faster you should reuse this parsing and keep sort_3/5 you would only need to change sort_100 and
scale it up.
