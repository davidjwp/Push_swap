there are two versions of my push swap, the finished and unfinished.

the way the finished version works is by finding the fastest way to send the right elements from stack A to stack B
then when stack A is empty push the biggest of stack b until stack B is empty.

This method works well but is a bit slow, it does not make use of double movements like RRR or RR thus it could be much faster.

The other push swap does not work and i gave up because it was taking me too much FUCKING time, and i couldn't figure out why it doesn't work
if in the future you want to finish it here is a remind of what it's supposed to do and what is fucked up :

it's supposed to work just like the other except that before shuffling the right element of stack A to the top to send it to stack b
depending of wether it is gonna be the biggest or smallest of stack B it will check if a double movement is possible, so stack A goes in a direction
and if that direction and the number of movements gets the right element to the top of stack B, even it there aren't enough movements in that 
direction for the right element to be put to the top it will check if it would be faster to do it the other way or to do a double movement along stack A
doing this you would take full advantage of double movement and get a faster sort since you would pre sort in stack B using the movements of stack A
when time comes to dump everything back to A it will be much faster.

you could either not sort if the movement is not enough thus only doing it if you have double movement, or complete the sort, i really don't know
which would be faster.

now for what's fucked:

-   numbers withing 90 crash for some reason

-   the output misses the last instruction

-   in this code the sort 5 can go above the limit of 12 which results in a fail

-   there is a weird thing with stack B where the values are completely wrong, it still works kinda somehow which makes it even weirder

-   the double movement is probably broken or the movements are wrong and badly accounted for

-   because sort 100 didn't work there is no sort 500

-   there is probably a TON of useless functions

-   some instructions might have bad values if you get a neverending loop, if the values are negatives it'll never stop

-   useless functions in the header

-   the makefile uses wildcard which is prohibited(why though ?)

-   the norm is raped

alright good luck lol 

(another idea that might be easier would be to do just like the first push_swap but before dumping from biggest, just dump all of it and sort as you dump idk)
